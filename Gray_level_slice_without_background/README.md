# ** Gray level slicing without background

---

Gray level slicing manipulates  group  of  intensity  levels  in  an image  up  to  specific  range  by  diminishing rest  or  by  leaving  them alone. Grey level slicing without background displays high values in the specific region of an image and low value  to  other  regions  by  ignoring  background.
In this notebook an image is taken where a range is highlight and reducing other to constant level.
