# Face-Recognition

-   This is a Real-Time Face Recognition with Python and OpenCV.
-   Basically, a Machine Learning project for detecting and recognizing user's face using sufficient testing and training datasets.
-   I have used Jupyter Notebook to write the testing and training scripts in Python

### [](https://github.com/ashishsahu1/ML-ProjectYard/blob/main/Face%20Mask%20Detection/README.md#steps)Steps:

1.  Install Jupyter Notebook

2.  Import all the Libraries and Modules required.
    
3.  Image Generation/Augmentation
    
4.  Train the Model
    
5.  Now, test the results of face recognition model using OpenCV.
    
6.  Run the project.
    
    ```
  # Sample Output
    Output image has been added with files.
